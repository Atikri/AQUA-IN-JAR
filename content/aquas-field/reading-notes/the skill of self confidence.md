The belief that you can accomplished it , self-confidence.
- repetition/persistence(10,000-hour rule).
- Do what you want to do and do not accept no.
- Stop the negative self-talk. **Thoughts influence actions.** We need to get our own self-affirmations.
- Get away from the people who will tear you down.
- Fix you!--Catch them when they're good.

> The misfits , the rebels , the troublemakers , the round pegs in the square holes. We're supposed to be different  folks. And when people look at us, believe in yourself!
